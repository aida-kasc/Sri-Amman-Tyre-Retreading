            <h1>What is Retreading:</h1>
            <div id="bar"></div>
            <p>
              &emsp; Retreading is a process of refurbishing worn-out or used tires to extend their lifespan and reuse them. It involves applying a new tread layer onto the tire's casing, which is the tire's structural body without the tread. The retreading process is carried out by specialized facilities and involves several steps to ensure the retreaded tire meets safety and quality standards.
            </p>
            <h1>Retreading steps we follow:</h1>
            <div id="bar"></div>
            <h3>Inspection:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; The used tire is thoroughly inspected to assess its suitability for retreading. Any damage, cuts, or punctures are identified, and only tires meeting specific criteria are selected for retreading.
            </p>
            <h3>Buffing:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; The old, worn-out tread is removed from the tire casing using a specialized machine called a tire buffer. This process creates a smooth and uniform surface on the tire, preparing it for the new tread.
            </p>
            <h3>Repair and Reinforcement:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; Any damage found during the inspection, such as small punctures or cuts, is repaired. Additionally, the tire may be reinforced with extra materials to ensure its structural integrity.
            </p>
            <h3>Applying New Tread:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; A fresh layer of new tread rubber is applied to the buffed tire casing. This tread is specially designed to suit the tire's intended use, whether it's for commercial trucks, passenger cars, or off-road vehicles.
            </p>
            <h3>Curing:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; The retreaded tire is placed in a curing chamber, where it is subjected to controlled heat and pressure. This process allows the new tread to bond securely to the tire casing, creating a strong and durable retreaded tire.
            </p>
            <h3>Final Inspection:</h3>
            <p>
              &emsp; Once the curing process is complete, the retreaded tire undergoes a final inspection to ensure it meets safety and quality standards. This inspection includes checks for proper bonding, uniformity, and any defects.
